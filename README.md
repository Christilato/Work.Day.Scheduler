# Work.Day.Scheduler
The purpose of this project was to create an organized work day scheduler to pre-plan tasks throughout the work day. This application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Moment JS, and JQuery technologies.

The application allows the user to input text into each hour time-block and save that task to their local storage in the browser using a save button. This functionality allows the user to refresh the page without losing any data they had previously entered.

Another key function of this page is automatic styling for each time-block based on the current time of day. Hours that occured in the past will appear with a gray background, the current hour will appear with a red background, and hours that occur in the future will appear with a green background.
